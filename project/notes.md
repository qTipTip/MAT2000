## 1. April

* Fixed the subject.

**  Writing about visualization of surfaces and using various algebraic
surfaces to highlight interesting mathematical properties. (See 'World record
surfaces by Oliver Labs'). Also, if time, include an appendix that mentions
some of the various visualization techniques, like ray tracing etc.
